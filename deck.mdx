# Jest in strict mode

_Finding and preventing flaky tests_

---

# About Me

- Wayfair - Frontend Auxiliary Engineering
- Improve developer experience at Wayfair
- Help teams build new React Apps
- Education - Pair programming
- Lots of tests, TDD

---

# It's difficult to get tests _right_

- What makes a good React test?
- Code worth testing is complex
- Asynchronous logic is not intuitive
- Tooling can fall short

---

# Flaky tests are not useful

> "Non-deterministic tests have two problems, firstly they are useless, secondly they are a virulent infection that can completely ruin your entire test suite."

- Martin Fowler

---

# False positive tests are dangerous

- No obvious issues
- Potentially harmful code
- Breaks other tests
- Insanely difficult to track down

# Not so fast

- Originally just wanted to check for runtime assertions
- Most test modules contain more than a single test
- Most useful tests involve async logic with React
- Async callbacks can and will escape a test!

# What do?

- Stress about it, a lot
- Use the Zone.js library

---

# Zone.js?

- Async context
- Can be used to "wrap" a function, like a test for example
- We can then intercept all async tasks

---

# jest-plugin-must-assert

- Wraps/patches the Jest API
- Captures errand async callbacks, ensures assertions happen
- If the test is active, async tasks continue, blocked otherwise
- Logs warnings to the console, with stack traces

---

# Using the plugin

![](./resources/usage.png)

---

# Demo

---

# Alternatives

- No global APIs
- The `avajs` approach

---

# Conclusion

- Correct test results!
- Detects flaky and false positive tests
- Gives the developer immediate feedback on test quality
- Prevents new flaky tests from entering the system
